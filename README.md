# Landing_Page
This repository is for the landing project page for the Odin Project.

The purpose of this project is to practice creating a website using flexbox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did not peek at solution so website may be designed differently than expected.

Links go to the various odin project pages that have helped me for this project.

Images were especially challenging but now shrink according to the size of the container.

Images created by me so no copyright infringement notice is needed.

Missing 3 commit logs before running into problems with pushing so commit history is missing the first three commit logs.I will remember to push more in the future.

Fixed using the following for my future reference,
